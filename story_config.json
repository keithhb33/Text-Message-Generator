When she confronts Mark, he gaslights her, making her believe that she agreed to it during a vulnerable moment, which she can't remember due to her history of mental health issues and substance abuse. As Anna starts to piece together the truth, she realizes that Mark has been systematically isolating her from her friends and family, subtly undermining her confidence and making her increasingly dependent on him.

In a nail-biting climax, Anna manages to outsmart Mark and escape, but not without a violent confrontation. She exposes Mark's crimes to the authorities, and he is arrested. The film ends with Anna starting a new life, but with lingering trauma from her experiences, showing that while she escaped the immediate danger, the psychological scars remain.
